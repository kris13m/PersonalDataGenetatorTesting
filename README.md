# PersonalDataGenetatorTesting
Opgavebeskrivelse/Requirements 

Design and implement unit, integration and end-to-end tests for an application that generates fake personal data for application tests.

##System under test

The application generates fake information for non-existing Danish persons with the following architecture:

- A backend that serves the requested information via an API
- A graphic UI that consumes the API
The backend contains either a series of functions or a class with a series of public methods that return:

Name and gender. Compound information:
- First name
- Last name
- Gender
Randomly extracted from the provided file person-names.json

CPR. 10 numeric digits
- The first six ones identify the date of birth in the format ddMMyy
- The last four digits are randomly generated, with the following constraint:
- For female persons, the final number is even
- For male persons, the final number is odd

Date of birth. Must match the date in the CPR

Address. Compound information:
Street. A random assortment of alphabetic characters
Number. A number from 1 to 999 optionally followed by an uppercase letter (e.g., 43B)
Floor. Either “st” or a number from 1 to 99
Door. “th”, “mf”, “tv”, a number from 1 to 50, or a lowercase letter optionally followed by a dash, then followed by one to three numeric digits (e.g., c3, d-14)
Postal code and town. Randomly extracted from the provided database addresses.sql

Mobile phone number
Format: Eight numeric digits
It must start by some of the following digit combinations: 2, 30, 31, 40, 41, 42, 50, 51, 52, 53, 60, 61, 71, 81, 91, 92, 93, 342, 344-349, 356-357, 359, 362, 365-366, 389, 398, 431, 441, 462, 466, 468, 472, 474, 476, 478, 485-486, 488-489, 493-496, 498-499, 542-543, 545, 551-552, 556, 571-574, 577, 579, 584, 586-587, 589, 597-598, 627, 629, 641, 649, 658, 662-665, 667, 692-694, 697, 771-772, 782-783, 785-786, 788-789, 826-827, 829

Functionalities. There must be one functions/methods and a corresponding API endpoint for each of the following functionalities:

Return a fake CPR
Return a fake first name, last name and gender
Return a fake first name, last name, gender and date of birth
Return a fake CPR, first name, last name and gender
Return a fake CPR, first name, last name, gender and date of birth
Return a fake address
Return a fake mobile phone number
Return all information for a fake person       
(CPR, first name, last name, gender, date of birth, address, mobile phone number)
Return fake person information in bulk (all information for 2 to 100 persons)

It is at the group’s convenience to choose:

- The programming language(s) and framework(s)
- The API format (e.g., REST)
- Whether a database other than MySQL/MariaDB will be used (a data migration would be necessary)
- The output format of both the functions/methods and the API (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV, formatted 
  text, standard output)

Feel free to use my application code (either directly or as inspiration):

Backend (MariaDB / PHP8): https://github.com/arturomorarioja/fake_info/
Frontend (JavaScript / CSS3 / HTML5): https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_fake_info_frontend
Testing

The following testing-related tasks must be implemented:

Write unit tests and integration tests whenever it is considered appropriate
Write API tests in Postman, Insomnia, Thunder Client or similar
Design the test cases based on:
Black-box design techniques (manual analysis)
White-box design techniques (automated analysis with tools)
Use static testing tools (beyond linters) to analyse and improve the code.   
Also for white-box analysis, if the chosen unit testing framework does not provide it
Create a Continuous Integration job or pipeline to test the integration of the application
Implement continuous testing by running all unit and integration tests in the CI process
Design and write end-to-end test(s) in Cypress, Selenium WebDriver, Playwright or similar

# Delivery

The assignment must be delivered to Fronter in one zip file by 21 October 2024, 23:59:

The source code of the application
The database creation and population script if it is different from the one provided
The source code of the unit tests, integration tests in code, and end-to-end tests
The CI configuration files       
(XML, YAML or whatever format the CI tool uses. A screenshot is also acceptable)
A pdf file explaining how black-box design techniques were applied to the definition of test cases
(e.g., definition of valid and non-valid partitions, boundary values, decision tables if applicable…)
Screenshots of the static testing tool(s) used that show the value they brought to the testing activities

# Presentation

On 22 October 2024 each group will make a presentation where they will show and explain the whole assignment to the rest of the class:

Demo of the application at work
The code of the application
The code of the unit, integration and end-to-end tests
The code of the API tests
The criteria behind test case design:
Black-box techniques
White-box techniques
The value brought by the static testing tools used (including white-box analysis, if appropriate)
The CI job or pipeline
Walkthrough of the configuration
A demo of the process
The presentation time is limited to 8 minutes per group and all group members must present a part.
